<div>
   Exports the status of a続 at the end of the a続 analysis build step run as a workspace .apx file. 
   This workspace file can later be opened in an interactive run of a続. The result is that the a続 
   GUI then shows all messages and all results generated by the batch-mode analyses without the need 
   to run these analyses again.
